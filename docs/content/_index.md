# Homelab Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for my homelab project. This guide will help you understand, set up, and maintain your own homelab infrastructure.

## What is a Homelab?

A homelab is a laboratory at home where you can:
- Self-host services and applications
- Experiment with new technologies
- Practice for certifications
- Learn and develop infrastructure skills

For more information, please see the [r/homelab introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction) and the [Home Operations Discord community](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home).
